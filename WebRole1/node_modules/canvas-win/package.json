This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with\r\n    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. \".cpp\" files are associated with the\r\n    \"Source Files\" filter).\r\n\r\nnode-canvas-win.cpp\r\n    This is the main DLL source file.\r\n\r\n\tWhen created, this DLL does not export any symbols. As a result, it\r\n\twill not produce a .lib file when it is built. If you wish this project\r\n\tto be a project dependency of some other project, you will either need to\r\n\tadd code to export some symbols from the DLL so that an export library\r\n\twill be produced, or you can set the Ignore Input Library property to Yes\r\n\ton the General propert page of the Linker folder in the project's Property\r\n\tPages dialog box.\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\nOther standard files:\r\n\r\nStdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp\r\n    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file\r\n    named node-canvas-win.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\nAppWizard uses \"TODO:\" comments to indicate parts of the source code you\r\nshould add to or customize.\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n",
